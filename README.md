Some clean data and code tips on Carbon Emissions, Brazilian Economy and World Indicators. 

Hi, welcome to my dataset. I have been working on this project in order to share some clean general (and diverse) datasets that I've been using on dat-to-day work. Numbers cover topics on the Environment, the Economy, Government, Demographics and so on. 

Tips and comments are totally welcome!
