# My Data Repo
## Introduction 
Hi! welcome to my dataset. 
I have been working on this project in order to share some clean general (and diverse) datasets that I've been using on dat-to-day work. Numbers cover topics on the Environment, the Economy, Government, Demographics and so on. Tried my best to comment every line and share cool packages. Mostly done in R. 

Tips and comments are totally welcome!
